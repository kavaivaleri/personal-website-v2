Contributing Editor at AI & ML newsletter with 90,000+ subscribers including researchers, engineers, and executives at major tech companies.

## What I Did

Authored technical explainers, company profiles, and historical series using forward and backward citation tracking to analyze research articles and understand concept development.

**Content types**: Technical explainers, AI unicorn profiles, historical analysis series, compilations based on expert comments.

## Results

Key milestone: [JEPA explainer](https://www.turingpost.com/p/jepa) received endorsement from Yann LeCun, JEPA creator and one of the godfathers of AI, who called it an "Excellent blog post" on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yann-lecun_excellent-blog-post-from-turing-post-on-jepa-activity-7212375691353321472-CHyy) and [Twitter/X](https://x.com/ylecun/status/1806610020974362819?lang=en).

# About

I'm a content manager and technical writer specializing in AI/ML. I develop content strategies and write technical content that makes complex topics more accessible.

## Experience

Currently, I work as Content Manager at DataTalksClub, where I lead content strategy across social media, blog, and newsletters. Previously, I was Head of Content at Learn Prompting, where I managed the content strategy across documentation, blog, newsletter, and social media.

I've also worked as Contributing Editor at TuringPost, managing social media strategy and writing technical content about AI/ML topics including Transformers, RAG, and company profiles. Before that, I was Social Media Marketing Specialist at TheSequence.

My technical writing covers topics like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Chain-of-Thought prompting, and Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA). My JEPA article received positive feedback from its creator, Yann LeCun.

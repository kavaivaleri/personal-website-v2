I [decided to join AI DevTools Zoomcamp](/blog/do-i-use-ai) and was genuinely curious what I'd be able to build.

In the first module of the course, we build a TODO app using the Django framework.

Side note:
I knew *nothing* about Django before starting the course.

For someone who doesn't come from a classic software engineering background, AI tools are a huge unlock. They don't magically make you a senior developer overnight, but they *do* lower the barrier so you can build real projects, see how things work under the hood, and learn by doing.

Insane, but: It took about 10 minutes for Cursor to scaffold a working Django TODO app. I followed the homework instructions, asked the AI to build the project, and watched it piece everything together.

While the model was generating code, I tried to reverse-engineer what it was doing:

- Django app structure
- Component connections
- File responsibilities

That alone was a great learning experience.

Then I started experimenting a bit more and created a girly-pixelated version (pushed to the extreme 😂🌸) with a calendar view and repeated tasks. It definitely needs work (the font is unreadable and repeating events don't actually repeat yet). But it was a fun way to explore how far I could push the interface with AI assistance.

Overall, I had a lot of fun with this module!

Not sure if I "built" it or "watched it build itself," but both felt equally fascinating.

  "content": "**\"Are you actually using AI in your everyday life?\"**\n\nShort answer: yes. A lot.\n\nI started using AI tools around the time ChatGPT first came out. Back then, I mainly used it as a marketer: small content edits, alternative headlines, structure suggestions. It was helpful, but also quite limited and prone to obvious errors.\n\nFast-forward to today: the tools are much more powerful, but one thing hasn't changed — I still treat AI as a **companion**, not a full replacement. Even if you hire a human, you still review their work. Same with AI: it can speed you up, but you stay responsible for the final output.\n\nBecause I work in startup environments and often wear \"technical\" hats (think technical SEO, website updates, landing pages), I decided to lean into this and invest in my skills. I joined **AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp**, a course that teaches developers to work more productively with AI: coding assistants, agents, automation tools, all of that.\n\nI already use AI to:\n\n- Draft and iterate on landing pages\n- Generate small scripts for technical SEO (for example, adding or updating structured data)\n- Experiment with how websites are built and styled, using AI to suggest code changes and then reverse-engineering what happened\n\nOn AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp, the module that interests me the most is [building an AI coding agent](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/ai-dev-tools-zoomcamp/tree/main/04-build-coding-agent). I hope it will help me understand how agents are built and how I can use them in my work. Since I've already tried using LLMs with an API, I'm curious how agentic features can expand their capabilities and what I would be able to build with them.",

  "content": "I [decided to join AI DevTools Zoomcamp](/blog/do-i-use-ai) and was genuinely curious what I'd be able to build.\n\nIn the first module of the course, we build a TODO app using the Django framework.\n\nSide note:\nI knew *nothing* about Django before starting the course.\n\nFor someone who doesn't come from a classic software engineering background, AI tools are a huge unlock. They don't magically make you a senior developer overnight, but they *do* lower the barrier so you can build real projects, see how things work under the hood, and learn by doing.\n\nInsane, but: It took about 10 minutes for Cursor to scaffold a working Django TODO app. I followed the homework instructions, asked the AI to build the project, and watched it piece everything together.\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/images/blog/simple-to-do-app.png\" alt=\"Simple To-Do App\" />\n  <figcaption>Simple To-Do App</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nWhile the model was generating code, I tried to reverse-engineer what it was doing:\n\n- Django app structure\n- Component connections\n- File responsibilities\n\nThat alone was a great learning experience.\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/images/blog/girly-version-to-do-view.png\" alt=\"Girly Version To-Do View\" />\n  <figcaption>Girly Version To-Do View</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThen I started experimenting a bit more and created a girly-pixelated version (pushed to the extreme 😂🌸) with a calendar view and repeated tasks.\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/images/blog/girly-version-task.png\" alt=\"Girly Version Task View\" />\n  <figcaption>Girly Version Task View</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/images/blog/girly-version-calendar-view.png\" alt=\"Girly Version Calendar View\" />\n  <figcaption>Girly Version Calendar View</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nIt definitely needs work (the font is unreadable and repeating events don't actually repeat yet). But it was a fun way to explore how far I could push the interface with AI assistance.\n\nOverall, I had a lot of fun with this module!\n\nNot sure if I \"built\" it or \"watched it build itself,\" but both felt equally fascinating.\n\n> You can find the code for the simple version on my [GitHub](https://github.com/kavaivaleri/ai-dev-tools-zoomcamp-2025/tree/main/01-todo).",
